Installation
---

1. Clone the GIT repository

2. Compile the source code in the ./caffe directory and the matlab interface following the installation instruction of caffe.

3. Download the VGG_ILSVRC_16_layers.caffemodel (553.4 MB) from https://gist.github.com/ksimonyan/211839e770f7b538e2d8, and put the caffemodel file under the ./model directory.

4. Download imagenet-vgg-m-2048 (345 MB) from http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/, and put the file into ./networks . 

5. Compile matconvnet in the ./external_libs folders.

6. Run the demo code demo_RPCF.m to test the code. You can customize your own test sequences following this example.

7. Modify the configSeq.m to your OTB dataset path, then run run_RPCF.m on all 100 datasets.
